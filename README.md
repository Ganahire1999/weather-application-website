Set up the backend:

Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., app.js) and require the necessary modules (Express, hbs , path).
Configure Express to listen on a specific port (e.g., 3000) using app.listen(3000).//  localhost:3000  //    port name url 
Define routes to handle incoming requests. For example, you might have a route to handle the homepage (/) and another route to handle the weather data retrieval.
Within the weather route, make an API request to a weather data provider (such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) using hbs ,path.
Retrieve the weather data and pass it to a template engine like EJS to render the HTML page dynamically.

Set up the frontend:

Create a folder for your frontend files (e.g., public) in your project directory.
Add HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript files to the public folder to create your user interface.
Link your frontend files in your HTML files using appropriate <script> and <link> tags.
  
  
  Connect the frontend and backend:

Use EJS to render the dynamic data received from the server-side in your HTML templates.
Make AJAX requests from your client-side JavaScript to the server-side routes using fetch() or similar methods to retrieve the weather data.
  
  
  Test your application:
  Start your server by running node src/app.js or using a tool like Nodemon (npx nodemon app.js) for automatic server restarts on file changes.
Open your web browser and navigate to localhost:3000 (or the port you specified) to see your weather application in action.
